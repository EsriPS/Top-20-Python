## Hours
- We have 250 hours total for the first draft
	- We can request more if we end up needing them
	- We'll get more time for editing and correspondence
## Writing / Style
- We'll use an informal voice
- Each chapter includes two tutorials, which should take about 45 min total
- Wherever possible, we need to take a learn by doing approach, introducing ideas to readers as they progress through tutorials
- It's best for us to develop a solid TOC early on
	- But we're not required to submit it
- The Word template styling is not what actually goes to print
	- Esri Press will use Adobe InDesign to map styles from Word to styles that will be used for print
	- The actual style used looks a lot better
- Craig will send us a PDF of a sample book to get a better idea of what has been done so far

## Making and Publishing Content
- We can use GitHub to host a repo of content related to the book for readers
- We're ok to use VS Code and Jupyter Notebook, but we need to be sure to include Esri products somewhere in the book

## Moving Forward 
- Two people are currently reviewing our TOC
	- Reviews are going well, there will only be minor changes
- Alycia will send the memo and charge code by the end of the week
- We should try to get them a sample chapter before Thanksgiving
- We can talk about this whenever, we don't need to wait for an official announcement
- Book will be available for pre-order mid-February 2024
- Book will be shipping by September 4th, 2024
