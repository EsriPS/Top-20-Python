    "When we're writing Python scripts, we'll often need to use some conditional logic.  The most commonly used flow operator in Python for this use-case is the if/else block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pick a logical test we can use to explore if/else logic.  The modulus (%) operator in Python gives us the remainder of a divison operation.  For example, the modulus remainder of 4 divided by 2 would be 0, so `4 % 2` would give us a result of `0`.  The remainder of 3 divided by 2, however, would be 1, so `3 % 2` would give us a result of `1`.  We can use this as a simple test of whether a number is even.  This is a good simple example we can use to explore script flow."

In our case, if a number doesn't meet the first condition, we can check another in sequential order.  We move on that way through our script until we get to the *else* condition."
